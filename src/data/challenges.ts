    description: `You've discovered a vulnerable smart contract that implements basic ownership functionality. 
    Your mission is to take control by manipulating the contract's storage directly.


    The contract uses Stylus's storage system, but there might be a way to bypass the intended access controls.
    Can you find the vulnerability and claim ownership? \n\n


    **Objectives**:\n
    - Analyze how Stylus handles contract storage\n
    - Find a way to modify the owner state without using standard ownership transfer\n
    - Successfully become the new owner\n
    - Ensure proper event emission\n

    
    **Initial Setup**:\n
    - Contract is deployed with another owner\n
    - Standard ownership transfer is protected\n
    - You have no special privileges`,
